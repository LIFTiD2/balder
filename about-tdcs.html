										The simple answer is “yes”. Although only 25% of the current delivered through the tDCS electrodes reaches the brain, since much of the current is absorbed by the skin and bone, studies have clearly shown alterations in the physiology of the underlying brain cells. A 2mA stimulus intensity applied to the skin generates <0.5 V/m fields in brain which generates 0.1-0.2 mV changes in membrane potential of the brains’ neurons. This amount of current cannot make the cells fire, but it can depolarize the membranes of the cells making them easier to fire and enhancing their excitability. In addition to impacting neurons, tDCS can stimulate blood vessels and other cells in the brain called astrocytes.  Studies using functional MRI, which measure blood volume and oxygenation in the brain have shown that tDCS can increase blood flow and oxygenation in the brain underlying the electrodes. An increase in oxygenation in the brain may help nourish neurons and enhance their ability to perform optimally. Meanwhile, astrocytes, the cells that support the neurons in the brain and clean up waste, show dramatic increases in calcium with tDCS indicating that their activity is also enhanced.  How this impacts brain function is not well understood but the function of astrocytes is to soak up the neurotransmitters released by neurons when they communicate with each other. If the astrocytes are working harder, it may just reflect an increase in neuronal activity in the surrounding neurons.

										The simple answer is “yes”.  While some functions in the brain are widely distributed, such as long term memory, the brain is generally organized into localized compartments and each compartment has a different function. The tDCS device sits over one a specific location in the forehead, namely the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).  Several studies have demonstrated that the DLPFC is important for attention, memory and decision-making.  Hence, stimulation in this area will have an impact specifically on these abilities.  If you read an article about tDCS and its effects on the brain, make sure to pay attention to where the electrodes are placed.  For example, some studies may show effects on motor response or visual processing and the electrodes may be placed over motor cortex or visual cortex.  However, choosing DLPFC as the site of the electrodes will maximally improve attention, focus, concentration and performance based on existing scientific studies showing enhancement in these abilities with electrodes in this location.

										<p>There are several studies that have been performed to assess the impact of tDCS electrodes placed over the forehead (the general location of F3 and F4 over DLPFC).  Some studies are well designed, with control groups and objective measurements of focus, attention and processing speed. Others are not well-designed and should read with skepticism. In one very well designed study, McIntire et al. (see reference below), 50 men and women were divided into 4 groups and given tests of attention, reaction time and short term memory over a 36 hour period of sleep deprivation.  While one group received real tDCS, others received placebo tDCS and others received caffeine gum. In this study, the tDCS group had statistically significant better performance than the other groups. In another study by Nelson et al (see reference below), two groups of ten men and women were given either real or sham tDCS to DLPFC. Both groups were administered a test of multitasking.  The group receiving tDCS showed a rapid increase in their ability to multitask sustained over the course of the experiment. These studies and others like them indicate that the effects of tDCS are reproducible. However, studies with small groups can be prone to error and studies with larger populations may be required to confirm these results.</p>

										The simple answer is that, as far as current research studies have shown, tDCS is safe and will not cause harm to your brain. In over 3000 publications on tDCS, no permanent negative side effects have been reported.  The primary effects of tDCS are not permanent. In fact, many studies show that twenty minutes of tDCS alters brain physiology for roughly one hour, after which the brain’s function returns to its baseline.  This implies that the effects of tDCS are short lived and the device must be worn during the period of time when the effect is desired.  There are certain possible side effects in a subgroup of individuals with medical conditions listed in the warnings in the user manual and on the device website and these individuals should avoid tDCS. In general, people with neurological disorders that may be exacerbated by the device or with implanted electrical devices such as cardiac pacemakers should avoid commercial tDCS devices.  A subtle tingling feeling in the scalp underneath the electrodes is normal and not dangerous. This results from stimulation of the sensory nerves in the skin. It is important to follow the recommended guidelines for use of the device.  Longer duration of stimulation does not translate to an increased effect.
